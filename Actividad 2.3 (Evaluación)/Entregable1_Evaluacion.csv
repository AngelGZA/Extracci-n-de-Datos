I work in the design + hospitality space and love to host great people from all over the world. 

I'm a foodie and love finding new places to eat or drink at. I love fashion and interior design and can suggest great boutiques to shop at, or hidden hole in the wall restaurants for amazing food. I love listening to music such as hip hop, alternative, indie and electronic. Wes Anderson, and Stanley Kubrick are two of my favorite directors.

Other things to note about me as a host: I pride myself in a very clean place, I have OCD about cleanliness. All decor details in each of my apartments are all designed by me. My style is very minimalistic without any hassle.  I'm always available for contact through the airbnb app. Having me as a host will ensure you a great stay in this amazing city.

I love listening to music such as hip hop, alternative, indie and electronic. Wes Anderson, and Stanley Kubrick are two of my favorite directors.

Other things to note about me as a host: I pride myself in a very clean place, I have OCD about cleanliness. All decor details in each of my apartments are all designed by me.

I work in the design + hospitality space and love to host great people from all over the world. 

I'm a foodie and love finding new places to eat or drink at. I love fashion and interior design and can suggest great boutiques to shop at, or hidden hole in the wall restaurants for amazing food. I love listening to music such as hip hop, alternative, indie and electronic. Wes Anderson, and Stanley Kubrick are two of my favorite directors.

Other things to note about me as a host: I pride myself in a very clean place, I have OCD about cleanliness. All decor details in each of my apartments are all designed by me. My style is very minimalistic without any hassle.  I'm always available for contact through the airbnb app. Having me as a host will ensure you a great stay in this amazing city.
